# StealMyIdeas

ironically, stolen from lars doucet <https://stealmyideas.io/>

more ideas to steal <https://blog.ncase.me/backlog/>

## project ideas
- GUI client for [Spicetify](https://spicetify.app/) for easy use for people who don't know how to use the CLI
  - Make a simpler installer for Spicetify, one click install, which will both install spicetify, and then add something like a "themes" section
    a spicetify [app](https://spicetify.app/docs/advanced-usage/custom-apps) to swap and change themes easily
