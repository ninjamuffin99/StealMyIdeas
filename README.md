more ideas to steal <https://blog.ncase.me/backlog/>

## project ideas
- flash esque animation tool built with p5js scripting
- GUI client for [Spicetify](https://spicetify.app/) for easy use for people who don't know how to use the CLI
  - Make a simpler installer for Spicetify, one click install, which will both install spicetify, and then add something like a "themes" section
    a spicetify [app](https://spicetify.app/docs/advanced-usage/custom-apps) to swap and change themes easily

## FAQ (also [stolen from lars](https://stealmyideas.io/#faq)!)

Q: Do I need to credit you?  
A: That'd be nice, but I can't and won't enforce it. If you take one of these
ideas and turn it into something cool, I ask (but do not require) that you do 
two things: 1) put a line in the credits like "inspired by an idea from cameron taylor" or somesuch, and 2) tell me about it so I can check it out!

Q: Do I need to pay you?  
A: No. Please STEAL my ideas.

Q: Do you have a Patreon or something?  
A: I do have [kofi](https://ko-fi.com/ninjamuffin99) and [github sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/ninjamuffin99), but mostly as placeholders. 
If you insist on giving me money, I'll take it. 

Q: If you're just giving ideas away it's not really STEALING right?  
A: Correct. For the avoidance of doubt there's no real stealing going on here.
For one, I want you to take the ideas. Also, ideas are non-rival goods (at worst
you can copy an idea without permission, which is different from stealing, which
requires that you obtain something and at the same time meaningfull deprive 
someone else of the same thing. If you copy an idea, you aren't also deleting it
from the originator's brain or anything).

Q: What if I think YOU stole MY idea???  
A: I swear I didn't. Ever heard of 
[convergent evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_evolution)?
There's so many people in the world, with so many of us in similar environments
being exposed to the same ideas. It's inevitable that some of us are going to 
come up with some of the same stuff.

Q: I have some ideas I want people to steal too! Will you post them here for me?  
A: That's great of you! Unfortunately I can't, for a lot of reasons, but chiefly
because I can only take responsibility for the ideas that came out of my own
brain -- it'd be too easy to accidentally insert myself in all sorts of disputes
otherwise. BUT, if you make your own list, I'll happily link to it in a special
section of this site with the appropriate disclaimers.
